### Introduction:
In the ever-evolving world of web development, interactive elements enhance user experience by making web pages more engaging and intuitive. One such feature is creating dynamic and draggable points on a line, which can be used in various applications like data visualization, interactive timelines, or educational tools. This blog post delves into how to implement draggable points on a line with smooth transitions to handle overlaps and ensure a seamless user experience.




### Explanation:
Creating draggable points on a line involves several steps, including handling mouse events, adjusting positions to prevent overlaps, and ensuring smooth transitions for a polished look. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the key components:

1. **HTML Structure**:
   - A simple structure with a container for the line and buttons to add new points dynamically.

2. **CSS Styling**:
   - Basic styles to define the appearance of the points, labels, and line, including transitions for smooth animations.

3. **JavaScript Logic**:
   - Handling mouse events (`mousedown`, `mousemove`, `mouseup`) to enable dragging.
   - Adjusting positions to prevent points from overlapping.
   - Smoothly adjusting the vertical lines to avoid label overlaps.
